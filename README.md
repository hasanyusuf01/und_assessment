# Purpose and Scope
The Training System serves as the central orchestration layer for the DDPG reinforcement learning pipeline. It manages the complete training lifecycle from initialization through episode execution, experience collection, network updates, and performance evaluation. The system is implemented primarily through the Trainer class which coordinates interactions between the DDPG agent, environment, replay buffer, and logging subsystems.

For detailed information about the DDPG algorithm components themselves, see DDPG Algorithm Implementation. For environment-specific details, see Point Particle Environment. For data analysis capabilities, see Data Analysis and Visualization.


# Point Particle Environment
## Purpose and Scope
The Point Particle Environment provides a continuous 2D navigation simulation for reinforcement learning training. This environment implements a point particle agent that must navigate from a starting position to a goal while avoiding rectangular obstacles and boundary walls. The environment features sophisticated reward shaping, collision detection, and visual rendering capabilities.

This document covers the PointParticleEnv class implementation, including state/action spaces, physics simulation, reward computation, and rendering. For information about how this environment integrates with the training system, see Training System. For details about the DDPG agent that interacts with this environment, see DDPG Agent.

## Environment Configuration

The environment supports extensive configuration through initialization parameters:

| Parameter             | Type    | Default        | Description                           |
|-----------------------|---------|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| `size`                | tuple   | (50, 50)       | Environment dimensions                |
| `goal`                | array   | [45.0, 45.0]   | Goal position coordinates             |
| `exploring_starts`    | bool    | False          | Random vs fixed start position        |
| `obs`                 | bool    | False          | Include obstacles in state            |
| `action_range`        | tuple   | (0, 180)       | Action space bounds                   |
| `max_episode_steps`   | int     | 500            | Episode time limit                    |
| `obstacle_penalty`    | float   | 50.0           | Collision penalty                     |
| `wall_penalty`        | float   | 100.0          | Wall collision penalty                |
| `goal_reward`         | float   | 500.0          | Goal achievement bonus                |

## Obstacle Configuration

Predefined rectangular obstacles: `[(12, 12, 25, 15), (25, 25, 27, 37)]`  
Format: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` representing rectangle corners  
Can be modified by editing the `obstacles` list in initialization.



# Core Training Architecture
The Training System follows a centralized orchestration pattern where the Trainer class acts as the primary coordinator for all training activities.
## Environment Architecture
The PointParticleEnv class implements the OpenAI Gym interface and provides a complete 2D navigation simulation with the following key components:
